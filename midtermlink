Duration: 15 days
Part 1 (60) : You are to to find and  search and deal for colinearity in the data sets  used in the notebooks below
A)
      https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-in-python-collinearity-and-multicollinearity-4cc4dcd82b3f -> blood pressure
B)
          https://www.kaggle.com/omgavy/multicollinearity-analysis-eda/notebook  ->stdutent, vif

	C) https://www.kaggle.com/faressayah/linear-regression-house-price-prediction-> house price  prediction

For each model 
   1) determine your priors and likelyhoods
   2) regress each variable independently for the target
   3) Do the posteriror check
  4) do the multiple regression
 5) draw the possible casual dags
	6)  Explain the colinearity and how you have dealed with it.
   7)      apply vif to milk data.

Part  2 ) (40) Is inflation effect and interest rate   is the cause? (Tefe /Tüfe) when other factors included (like the currency value). 
Assume the proposition is true and draw casual DAGS accordingly. Then check for the testable implications.
Do a multiple regression including currency rate and interets rate. İnterpret them ! (beware of the time scales of data!)
Not: For grading you will explain your work . Deliver your calculations and explanations. A) as a jupyter notebook  and B) pdf /html file.
